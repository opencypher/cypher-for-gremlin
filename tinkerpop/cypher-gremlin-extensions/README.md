# Cypher and Gremlin differences

This page describes differences in Cypher and Gremlin, most of which could be addressed by [installing Gremlin Extensions for Cypher Support](#gremlin-cypherextensions).
   
You are very welcome to [suggest](https://github.com/opencypher/cypher-for-gremlin/issues) better translation or workaround.

## Extensions to Gremlin to enable full support for Cypher functionality

Some functionality is exclusive to Gremlin Servers with [Gremlin Extensions for Cypher Support](https://github.com/opencypher/cypher-for-gremlin/tree/master/tinkerpop/cypher-gremlin-extensions), commonly provided by the [Cypher Gremlin Server plugin](https://github.com/opencypher/cypher-for-gremlin/tree/master/tinkerpop/cypher-gremlin-server-plugin). For example, [functions](https://github.com/opencypher/cypher-for-gremlin/blob/master/tinkerpop/cypher-gremlin-extensions/src/main/java/org/opencypher/gremlin/traversal/CustomFunctions.java#L42) and [predicates](https://github.com/opencypher/cypher-for-gremlin/blob/master/tinkerpop/cypher-gremlin-extensions/src/main/java/org/opencypher/gremlin/traversal/CustomPredicate.java#L24) that are not available in Gremlin.

For examples, search for [tests](https://github.com/opencypher/cypher-for-gremlin/tree/master/testware/integration-tests/src/test/java/org/opencypher/gremlin/queries) with category `org.opencypher.gremlin.groups.SkipExtensions`.

### Installation

**âš  Note**: Gremlin Extensions for Cypher Support are not available for [cloud implementations](https://github.com/opencypher/cypher-for-gremlin/wiki/Gremlin-implementations) like Neptune or Cosmos DB.    

The easiest way to use this module is by installing the [Gremlin Server Cypher plugin](../cypher-gremlin-server-plugin) on the target Gremlin Server. The plugin includes all of the extensions and registers them on the Server.

Alternatively, add [CustomPredicate.java](src/main/java/org/opencypher/gremlin/traversal/CustomPredicate.java) and [CustomFunctions.java](src/main/java/org/opencypher/gremlin/traversal/CustomFunctions.java) to Gremlin Groovy script engine.

### Usage

If extensions are installed on target server and translation happens on client side, extensions should be explicitly enabled on client so resulting query can use it. For example:

* Java API:
    ```java
    Translator<String, GroovyPredicate> translator = Translator.builder()
        .gremlinGroovy()
        .enableCypherExtensions()
        .build(TranslatorFlavor.gremlinServer());
    ```
* Console:
    ```
    :remote connect opencypher.gremlin conf/remote-objects.yaml translate gremlin+cfog_server_extensions
    ```

### Custom Functions

* Type Conversion [functions](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/functions/scalar/): toString, toBoolean, toInteger, toFloat
* [String functions](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/functions/string/): reverse, substring, trim, toUpper, toLower...
* Precentile functions: [percentileCont](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/functions/aggregating/#functions-percentilecont), [percentileDisc](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/functions/aggregating/#functions-percentiledisc)
* [round](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/functions/mathematical-numeric/#functions-round) function

### Queries that require type information

There are no functions or predicates to get type in Gremlin.For example:

```cypher
WITH $p AS unknown
RETURN unknown[$k] AS r
```

Its unknown to parser which types are `p` and `k`. Depending on type translation to Gremlin could be:

* `values($k)` for vertex and edge
* `select($k)` for maps
* `range(Scope.local, $k, $k + 1)` for lists
* `constant(null)` if `k` or `p` are null

As Gremlin will throw exception step does not much type, custom functions are used for unknown type in:

* [properties function](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/functions/scalar/#functions-properties)
* Accessing element by index
* [size function](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/functions/scalar/#functions-size)

If neither type information and extensions are not available, CfoG relies on "best guess"

#### Plus operator

In Cypher, plus operator works with numbers, strings and arrays:

```cypher
RETURN 1 + 2 // 3
RETURN 'a' + 'b' // "ab"
RETURN [1, 2]+[3,4] // [1, 2, 3, 4]
RETURN [1, 2]+3 // [1, 2, 3]
```

In Gremlin different implementations required for each type:

* Numerals - Math Step
* Lists - `.union(select('list1').unfold(), select('list2').unfold()).fold())`
* String concatenation - not supported in Gremlin

If type information is unknown, or string concatenation - custom function is used. If Gremlin Extensions for Cypher Support are not installed, translation falls back to numeric operator.

### Queries with expression in parameter

Gremlin steps support only constant values. For example:
  - `MATCH (n) RETURN n SKIP toInteger(rand()*9)` gremlin `skip` step expects constants. No known way to pass dynamic variables

* List access by non-constant index
* non-constant plus operator

### Copying Properties from node to node

```cypher
MATCH (n:FROM)-[r]->(m:TO) SET m=n RETURN m
```

Gremlin property step only allows constant values

### Include Gremlin in Cypher query

See [Gremlin Function](../cypher-gremlin-server-client#gremlin-function)

## Workarounds

### Null handling

* Gremlin has not concept of `null`, steps
  ```groovy
  g.V().has('name', 'lop').values('notExising')
  //empty traversal

  g.V().has('name', 'lop').project('p').by(values('notExising'))
  //The provided traverser does not map to a value: v[3]->[PropertiesStep([notExising],value)]
  ```
* `null` value produces NullPointerException `g.inject(null)` 
* To represent Cypher `null` value, string token "  cypher.null"
* To produce `null` values

### Throwing exception


## Untranslatable queries

These are queries and [TCK scenarios](https://github.com/opencypher/cypher-for-gremlin/tree/master/testware/tck) in Cypher TCK without known translation to Gremlin. You are very welcome to [suggest](https://github.com/opencypher/cypher-for-gremlin/issues) translation or workaround.

## Label modification

TinkerPop3 Documentation documentation [states](https://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#_the_graph_structure): 

> Vertices are allowed a single **immutable** string label

In Cypher its [possible](https://neo4j.com/docs/developer-manual/current/cypher/clauses/set/#set-set-a-label-on-a-node) to modify label on a node.

Following TCK scenarios rely on that feature:

* LabelsAcceptance,"Adding a single label"
* LabelsAcceptance,"Ignore space before colon"
* LabelsAcceptance,"Ignoring intermediate whitespace 1"
* LabelsAcceptance,"Removing a label"
* LabelsAcceptance,"Removing a non-existent label"
* MergeNodeAcceptance,"Merge node with label add label on create"
* MergeNodeAcceptance,"Merge node with label add label on match when it exists"
* MergeNodeAcceptance,"Should be able to set labels on match and on create"
* MergeNodeAcceptance,"Should be able to set labels on match"
* NullAcceptance,"Ignore null when removing label"
* NullAcceptance,"Ignore null when setting label"
* RemoveAcceptance,"Remove a single label"
* SetAcceptance,"Add a label to a node"
* RemoveAcceptance,"Remove multiple labels"
* SetAcceptance,"Add a label to a node"
* LabelsAcceptance,"Adding multiple labels"

### Comparability

Gremlin traversal fails when comparing values with different types:

```groovy
g.inject(1).inject('string').max()  //fails java.lang.Integer cannot be cast to java.lang.String
```

```cypher
UNWIND [1, 'string'] AS x RETURN max(x) // returns 1
```

* Aggregation,"`max()` over list values"
* Aggregation,"`max()` over mixed numeric values"
* Aggregation,"`max()` over mixed values"
* Aggregation,"`max()` over strings"
* Aggregation,"`min()` over list values"
* Aggregation,"`min()` over mixed values"
* Aggregation,"`min()` over strings"
* Comparability,"Comparing strings and integers using > in a OR'd predicate "
* Comparability,"Comparing strings and integers using > in an AND'd predicate"


### Temporal Types

* There is no format for Temporal Types in Gremlin, so each [implementation](https://github.com/opencypher/cypher-for-gremlin/wiki/Gremlin-implementations) need to support storing
* Property access
  - Custom functions for `containerIndex`
* Arithmetics
  - Custom functions for `+` `-`
* Comparison
  - Property type is unknown
  - Custom predicates for all comparisons!


### Filtering elements

```
MATCH (n)-[r]->(m)
RETURN [n, r, m] AS r
```

* MatchAcceptance2.Projecting a list of nodes and relationships
  - Front end desctribes mixed list of nodes/relationships as `List<Any>`
* MatchAcceptance2.Projecting a map of nodes and relationships
  - Front end desctribes mixed map of nodes/relationships as `Map<Any>`


### Path equality

* PathEquality.Direction of traversed relationship is not significant for path equality, simple
  - Path comparison works different in Gremlin and considers direction. Possible by custom function.
* Gremlin and Cypher has different specifics, current implementation with set of workarounds covers most of common cases.

## Creating big ranges

Current implementation of numeric `range` in Cypher for Gremlin timeouts when creating big range (over 10000 elements):

```groovy
// range(1000000, 2000000)

g.inject('start').
        repeat(sideEffect(loops().
                is(gte(1000000)).
                aggregate('range'))).
        until(loops().is(gt(2000000))).
        select('range')
```

Following TCK scenario rely on that feature:

* AggregationAcceptance.No overflow during summation
    - Expects range from `1000000` to `2000000`
